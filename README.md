## 📄 Abstract
**Online Multi-Object Tracking** has been recently dominated by **Tracking-by-Detection** (TbD) methods, where recent advances 
rely on increasingly sophisticated heuristics for tracklet representation, feature fusion, and multi-stage matching. 
The key strength of TbD lies in its modular design, enabling the integration of specialized off-the-shelf models like 
motion predictors and re-identification. However, the extensive usage of human-crafted rules for temporal associations 
makes these methods inherently limited in their ability to capture the complex interplay between various tracking cues. 
In this work, we introduce **CAMEL**, a novel association module for Context-Aware Multi-Cue ExpLoitation, that learns 
resilient association strategies directly from data, breaking free from hand-crafted heuristics while maintaining TbD's 
valuable modularity.

</p>

At its core, CAMEL employs two transformer-based modules and relies on a novel **Association-Centric 
Training** scheme to effectively model the complex interactions between tracked targets and their various association cues. 
Unlike End-to-End Detection-by-Tracking approaches, our method remains lightweight and fast to train while being able 
to leverage external off-the-shelf models. Our proposed online tracking pipeline, CAMELTrack, achieves state-of-the-art 
performance on multiple tracking benchmarks.

We also provide (by default) the weights [camel_bbox_app_kps_global.ckpt](https://huggingface.co/trackinglaboratory/CAMELTrack/blob/main/camel_bbox_app_kps_global.ckpt) trained jointly on MOT17, DanceTrack, SportsMOT, and PoseTrack21, suitable for testing purposes.

## 🎯 Tracking

Run the following command to track, for example, on DanceTrack, with the checkpoint obtained from training, or the provided
model weights (pretrained weights are downloaded automatically when using the name from the table above) :

```bash
uv run tracklab -cn cameltrack dataset=dancetrack dataset.eval_set=test modules.track.checkpoint_path=camel_bbox_app_kps_dancetrack.ckpt
```

By default, this will create a new directory inside `outputs/cameltrack` which will contain a visualization of the
output for each sequence, in addition to the tracking output in MOT format.

## 💪 Training

### Training on a default dataset

You first have to run the complete tracking pipeline (without tracking, with a pre-trained
CAMELTrack or with a SORT-based tracker, like oc-sort), on train, validation (and testing) sets
for the dataset you want to train, and save the "Tracker States":
```bash
uv run tracklab -cn cameltrack dataset=dancetrack dataset.eval_set=train
uv run tracklab -cn cameltrack dataset=dancetrack dataset.eval_set=val
uv run tracklab -cn cameltrack dataset=dancetrack dataset.eval_set=test
```
By default, they are saved in the `states/` directory.

You can also use the Tracker States we provide for the
common MOT datasets [on huggingface](https://huggingface.co/trackinglaboratory/CAMELTrack/tree/main/states).

Once you have the Tracker States, you can put them in the dataset directory
(in `data_dir`, by default `./data/$DATASET`) under the `states/` directory, with the following names :
```text
data/
    DanceTrack/
        train/
        val/
        test/
        states/
            train.pklz
            val.pklz
            test.pklz
```

Once you have the Tracker States, run the following command to train on a specific dataset
(by default, DanceTrack) : 
```bash
uv run tracklab -cn cameltrack_train dataset=dancetrack
```


> [!NOTE]
> You can always modify the configuration in [cameltrack.yaml](cameltrack/configs/cameltrack.yaml), and in the
> other files inside this directory, instead of passing these values in the command line.
> 
> For example, to change the dataset for training, you can modify [camel.yaml](cameltrack/configs/modules/track/camel.yaml).

By default, this will create a new directory inside `outputs/cameltrack_train`, which will contain the checkpoints
to the created models, which can then be used for tracking and evaluation, by setting
the `modules.track.checkpoint_path` configuration key in [camel.yaml](cameltrack/configs/modules/track/camel.yaml#L4).

### Training on a custom dataset
To train on a custom dataset, you'll have to integrate it in tracklab, either by using the MOT format, or by implementing
a new dataset class. Once that's done, you can modify [cameltrack.yaml](cameltrack/configs/cameltrack.yaml), to point to
the new dataset.

## 🔍 Ideas for Further Work

Our motivation was to glue together strong expert pre-trained models (detection, reid, motion, pose, etc.) using a learned module instead of SORT-like heuristics (e.g. ByteTrack, DeepSORT, BoT-SORT, ...).  
This modular design contrasts with end-to-end (E2E) methods (MOTR, MOTIP, etc), which aim to learn everything jointly—including detection, re-identification, and motion—but often require large-scale training data, are computationally intensive, and struggle in real-world applications.  

While CAMELTrack provides a strong foundation, there is room for improvement.  
The authors will not pursue these directions further, so we encourage others to explore and build on this work.
Feel free to open an issue or contact the authors for any suggestion or question regarding these ideas.

### Suggested Research Directions

<details>
<summary>1. Self-Supervised Video Pre-Training</summary>

Self-supervised pre-training on large-scale video datasets is a promising path to improve temporal reasoning and generalization in MOT, particularly for end-to-end (E2E) methods that struggle without massive annotated data. Tasks like future frame prediction could naturally teach models about object motion and identity preservation—central to tracking—without requiring manual supervision.

</details>

<details>
<summary>2. Better Training Strategies</summary>

Our ablation studies show that data augmentation is crucial to reach state-of-the-art performance, but we only implemented basic strategies. There is clear room for improvement here.

</details>

<details>
<summary>3. Cross-Domain Tracking</summary>

Study how CAMELTrack behaves in cross-domain settings by training it on one domain (e.g. DanceTrack) and evaluating it on another (e.g. SportMOT), while keeping the CAMEL association module fixed. The idea is to replace only the off-the-shelf components (detector, ReID, etc.) with counterparts trained on the target domain. We believe that, unlike end-to-end methods—which learn all components jointly—CAMEL’s modular design may allow for easier adaptation to new domains, without retraining the learned association module.

</details>

<details>
<summary>4. Additional Cues</summary>

Extend CAMELTrack with domain-specific or general cues. Examples include jersey numbers for sports, license plates for vehicles, segmentation masks, monocular depth, or learned motion models. The architecture can naturally handle additional input modalities.

</details>

<details>
<summary>5. Alternative Designs</summary>

CAMELTrack aims to be simple and free of complex or handcrafted architectural design. Future work could however explore different architectures or custom training objectives.

</details>

<details>
<summary>6. Bridge the Gap with Detection-by-Tracking Methods</summary>

End-to-end methods like MOTR or SAM2 follow the detection-by-tracking paradigm, meaning they can use past information from their memory to help re-detect occluded targets in the current frame. CAMELTrack, like other tracking-by-detection methods, cannot currently do this as detection is performed independently at each frame. A possible extension would be to replace CAMEL’s YOLO module with a dedicated DETR-like detector, prompted with CAMEL’s track tokens from the previous frame to help re-detect previously tracked targets.

</details>

<details>
<summary>7. Latent Space Tracking with Detection Tokens</summary>

CAMELTrack currently relies on bounding box coordinates and image crops from YOLO. A promising direction would be to operate directly in the latent space of modern detectors like DETR, using their detection tokens as inputs to the association module. These tokens carry rich contextual information—including appearance, object relationships, and scene context—that are lost when reduced to spatial boxes alone. Leveraging this richer representation could help resolve ambiguities, such as overlapping targets, more effectively. This approach could complement rather than replace dedicated ReID models, which still provide stronger appearance cues due to their high resolution input image crop and their training on difficult ReID-specific datasets with hard triplets of samples.

</details>

<details>
<summary>8. Learned Tracklet Management</summary>

CAMELTrack currently focuses on frame-to-frame association but lacks an explicit mechanism for managing tracklet lifecycles. Future work could extend CAMEL to handle higher-level decisions such as when to pause a tracklet, when to resume it, or when to initialize a new one. Incorporating learned or rule-based tracklet management could improve robustness in scenarios involving occlusions, missed detections, false positives, or re-entries.
